Auto Menu Settings
==================

Adds content type settings that help automate the creation of menu items for
nodes. These include:

- Setting a default menu link title (with token support)
- Choosing which menu fields/settings will be visible to content authors

Backdrop core allows for the automatic creation of menu links for nodes, but the
menu link title defaults to the node title. If you want your menu link titles to
be based on a different field/property, this module is for you.
